# donkus

## Description
Donkus is a web platform that aims to connect users in order to manage and organize workgroups that need to have an unified environment where team members can communicate each others via chat messages and video conferences.

## Requirements
Donkus uses Sails.js as Node.js framework, and MongoDB for the database.

In order to use chat and video conference tools, it is neccesary to install [Licode](http://lynckia.com/licode/) on your server.

Once the project is clonned, you will must take the superserviceID and superserviceKey parameters provided after Nuve installation (see Licode documentation) and fill the corresponding fields in the config/licode.js.dist file (renaming it to licode.js).
